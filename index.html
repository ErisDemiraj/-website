                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p> Born and raised on the mean streets of Tirana, Chris Bennoit, aka DJ Chris, started his musical journey when he was 16, when he was given a musical instrument by his brother. 
                    It was at this moment that DJ Chris knew he wanted to be part of 'the scene'.
                    After receiving several offers, he joined Megaskull Records, who helped distribute his first internet release, 'Futuristic Future' in 2017. 
                    Suffice to say, the dj scene should be expecting big things from Chris Bennoit in 2023.
